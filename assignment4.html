            Here is all the documentation for assignment 4. For this assignment I used and IR receiver, remote, and Servo motor to do an action on the servo motor when the power button of the remote was pressed. I took the remote input, checked if the IR code was for the power button, then rotated the servo motor.

            <h2>Schematic</h2>
            <p>
                These are the schematics for my IR receiver and Servo motor.

            <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <p>
                Here is my breadboard and arduino connected to my IR receiver and Servo motor. Note that I connected my IR receiver to 3.3V, as I found it was more responsive and still had sufficient power.

            <h2>Firmware</h2>
            <p>
                <p>
                    This is my code that tracks the input of the remote and rotates the Servo motor.
