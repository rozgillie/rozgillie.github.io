            Here is all the documentation for assignment 1. For this assignment I have three blinking LED's, all blinking for different lengths. I used a breadboard and an arduino board to program the lights blinking.

            <h2>Schematic</h2>
            <p>
                These are the schematics for my three LEDs, which were plugged into pins 2, 3, and 4. The red and green LED's have 2200 ohm resistors, while the blue LED has a 100 ohm resistor. Here is the math that went into choosing the resistors:
                <code>
                    5V - 1.8V drop for red and green
                    3.2V
                    3.2/.02 = 160 -> 220 ohm resistor
                    5V- 3.2drop for blue
                    1.8V
                    1.8/.02 = 90 ohms -> 100 ohm resistor   
                </code>

                Here is my breadboard and arduino.

            <h2>Firmware</h2>
            <p>
                <p>
                    This is my code that creates the pattern the LED's are making.
                </p>
                <code>
                    void setup() { //initializes LED variables
                        pinMode(4, OUTPUT); //Red in pin 4
                        pinMode(3, OUTPUT); //Green in pin 3
                        pinMode(2, OUTPUT); //Blue in pin 2
                      }
                      //
                      void loop() { //loops through LED patterns
                        digitalWrite(4, HIGH); //red on
                        digitalWrite(3, LOW); //green off
                        digitalWrite(2, LOW); //blue off
                        delay(1000); //one second delay
                        digitalWrite(4, LOW); //red off
                        digitalWrite(3, HIGH); //green on
                        digitalWrite(2, LOW); //blue off
                        delay(500); //half second delay
                        digitalWrite(4, HIGH); //red on
                        digitalWrite(3, LOW); //green off
                        digitalWrite(2, HIGH); // blue on
                        delay(250); // quarter second delay
                      }
