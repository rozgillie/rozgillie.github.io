            Here is all the documentation for assignment 5. For this assignment I used an IR receiver, remote, and LED strips to control the LED strip via the remote. I took the remote input, checked if the IR code was for the up/ down buttons, then adjusted the LED strip brighntess accordingly.

            <h2>Schematic</h2>
            <p>
                These are the schematics for my IR receiver and the N-MOSFET transistor with my LED strip.

            <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <p>
                Here is my breadboard and arduino connected to my IR receiver and LED strip. Note that I connected my IR receiver to 3.3V, as I found it was more responsive and still had sufficient power.

            <h2>Firmware</h2>
            <p>
                <p>
                    This is my code that tracks the input of the remote and changes the brightness of the LED strip.
