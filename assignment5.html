            <h1>My Assignment 5!</h1>

            Here is all the documentation for assignment 5. For this assignment I used an IR receiver, remote, and LED strips to control the LED strip via the remote. I took the remote input, checked if the IR code was for the up/ down buttons, then adjusted the LED strip brightness accordingly.

            <h2>Schematic</h2>
            <p>
                These are the schematics for my IR receiver and the N-MOSFET transistor with my LED strip. The transistor has a max current of 32A, and below I calculate how much current is drawn by the LED strip.  
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        White LEDs voltage drop: 3.3 V
                        LED resistor: 181 ohms
                        3 * 3.3 = 9.9 V
                        12 - 9.9 = 2.1 V drop across resistor
                        18 * 10 = 180 ohms
                        2.1/ 180 = .011666 A = 11.7 mA
                        The current drawn by the LEDs is less than the max current of the transistor.

            <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <p>
                Here is my breadboard and arduino connected to my IR receiver and LED strip. Note that I connected my IR receiver to 3.3V, as I found it was more responsive and still had sufficient power.

            <h2>Firmware</h2>
            <p>
                <p>
                    This is my code that tracks the input of the remote and changes the brightness of the LED strip.
